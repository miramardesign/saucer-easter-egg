Flying Saucer Easter  Egg

Click on a text element in the page, and then a designated button transforms into 
a flying  saucer, flies over your target element zaps it with a laser, then 
flies away. The page is then reset perfectly like nothing happened.

Usage:
    $('#saucer-target-center').flyingSaucerAttack({saucer: '#saucer-btn-center');
